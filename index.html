        "Having a Coke with You"

            is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne
            or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona
            partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian
            partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yogurt
            partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches
            partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary
            it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still
            as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it
            in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth
            between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles

            and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint
            you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them

            I look
            at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world
            except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick
            which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together the first time
            and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism
            just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or
            at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me
            and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them
            when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank
            or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully
            as the horse
            it seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience
            which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I am telling you about it

            This is by far one of my favourite poems. Partly beacuse its speaks about love and romance( which im a total sucker for).
            Partly beacuse it speaks about the wonders of the world. Partly because it's simply amazing.
            The way in which the poet speaks so enthusiactically about love, makes this by far on of the most vivid poems I've ever read.

    </p>

        I've never really understood how to describe love to another person. Somehow this poem made me reaise that there is no set explination for love.
        The poet does not describe love, not even once, throughout the entire poem. Rather, he describes how it makes him. He speaks about the all the wonders his ever known in this world.
        How they have finally been revealed to him their beauty, But also how their beauty would never compare to that of the one he loves.
    </p>

        Something i find rather interesting, is that even though he does not describe love, the poem still tell us so much about it, or rather how undescribal it really is.
        Take a look at his use of punctuation. There is none realy. which to me says that love is exactly what you make of it. it can not be bound by human laws.
        You yourself can define it in your own way. You can choose to rush through the poem (Love), or you can choose to take your time and pause where ever you see fit.

        Either way, love is and will ever remain unpredictable.
