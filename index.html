    <P>
         Hi there, My name is Zariyah. Welcome to my website.<br>
         I am a historian as well as war photographer. I've been classified by society as an introvert,<br>
         and honestly they are right.<br> I dont really believe in religion, but i do believe in a higher power.<br>
         Im still kinda trying to figure out where I fit into this universe as well as  my purpose.<br>
         And well I guess for now I hope enjoy my content.

    </P>
