<H4>The Library of Babel</H4>
<p>
    As I read through the first passage, my mind began to conjure the library.
    Although it still left me with many questions.
    Why is the library used a metaphor for the universe?
    Is the library infinite or indefinite?
    What was so significant about the shape of the library?
    And what is this “catalog of catalogs”.
</p>
<p>
    I myself believe that the universe is ever expanding and thus id considered it to be infinite.
    Perhaps his answers the question to why the circumference of the library can never be defined.
    But does this mean that the knowledge within the books of the library expands simultanoulsy.
    Or does it already have a booked about this expansion.
    After all the library does hold records of everything that was, that is or ever will be. 

</p>
<p>
    One downside to this library or infinite knowledge, is that there is no order and that some books could contain false or partially false information.
    Therefore what we see as gems could possible be coal.
    Does this render the library as useless as that of an empty one.
    Afterall what good is knowledge if not that of which one needs.
    With that said, can one argue the universe is more senseless rather then sensical as Borges states. 
    And could that be the reason we turn to religion.
    Because we can not obtain the answer we truly seek.

</p>

<p>
    One question that I could not be answered was whether or not the catalogue existed.
    Afterall, if the library consisted of all books surely there must be a book that explains the existence of the library.
    An index that could help us understand this labyrinth we call the universe, and could this index be seen as the true meaning of life within it.
    
</p>

<p>
    Or is all this just another example of how we set ourselves on wild goose chases, in search of the meaning of universe, in search of the meaning of life.
    And when we hit a stone wall within this labyrinth of life, we turn towards our “unknown gods”. 
    Could this be the aim of the library.
    To deceive us into chasing answers well never find. Chasing knowledge well never obtain.
    Readings books of other authors instead of writing our own.
