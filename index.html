                <P>
                    Hi there, My name is Zariyah. Welcome to my website. I am a historian as well as war photographer. I've recently decided to start writing  poetry. I've been classified by society as an introvert, and honestly they are right. I dont really believe in religion, but i do believe in a higher power.<br>
                    Im still kinda trying to figure out where I fit into this universe as well as  my purpose. And well I guess for now I hope enjoy my content.
            
                </P>
            
                "Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value.
                For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, 
                and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.‚Äù<br>
                ~ Oscar Wilde<br>
                (1854-1900)<br>

                            <p>
                                This blog will once again cover the paper, "Towards a study of information geographies ", wriiten by Mark Graham et al's.
                                We will be looking at the difference in geographies before and after the information revolution. How information was/is collected, controlled and used. 
                                How the change in geogrphy was brought about and the main causes of this changed.

                            <p>
                                As a war journalist and photographer my life is constantly at risk. Everytime, before I go onto the battlefield, I attempt to write a letter.
                                At first the letters were meant for my mother, but even then I had nothing to say. How exatly to speak to someone after you have died.

                            They say you always remember your first, well they are right.
                            On my first day at war, I was joined by three other journalist. I was excited, to be honest it felt like I was going on an adventure.
                            It all felt like a movie, like I was reliving my favourite game.
                            In the begining everything felt calm, but then everything suddenly changed almost as fast as I could say: "Shit". Stranded within a cloud of dust, I heard the distant screaming of the otheres.

        So recently I have discorvered that I have a love for space, well not really recently, more like somethhing that always been there, but gradually died out.
        Well now its back. ALSO FunFact:<br>
        When I was little and thought about being in this hell hole we call adulthood, I always wanted to be an Inter-Galactic Space-Soldier. 
        To be honest i loved the idea of travelling and exploring space, and when I heard my father was a soldier, I said hey, I could be like my dad and protect our universe.
        Thus:<h1>Inter-Galactic Space-Soldier.</h1>

        Anyway I would always find myself staring into the vast unknown of space, looking at NASA's latest pictures and honestly sometimes I'd talk to the stars.
        Well actually one star in particular, <h2>Antares</h2> , The heart of the Scorpian. She has always been like a personal therapist for me (is that weird, nah, I don't think its weird, is it?)
        <p>
            Anyway if you are into these kinds of things like me, take a look at NASA's Picture of the Day.
