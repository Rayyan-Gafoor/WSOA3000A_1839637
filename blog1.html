                <H4>The Library of Babel</H4>
                <p>
                    As I read through the first passage, my mind conjured the fictional library.
                    Although I was still left with many questions.
                    Why is this library used as a metaphor for the universe?
                    Is this library infinite or indefinite?
                    What was so significant about the shape of this library?
                    And what is this “catalog of catalogs”?
                    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I believe that the universe is ever expanding and is thus considered infinite.
                    Perhaps this answers the question as to why the circumference of the library can never be defined.
                    But does this mean that the knowledge within the books of the library expands simultanoulsy with the expansion of the universe?.
                    Or does it already have a book about this knowledge alongside universal expansion?
                    After all, the library does hold records of everything that was, that is, or ever will be. 
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    One downside to this library of infinite knowledge is that there is no order and that some books may contain false or partially false information.
                    Therefore, what we see as gems could possible be coal.
                    Does this render the library as useless such as that of an empty one?
                    Afterall, what good is knowledge if not that of which one needs.
                    With that said, can one argue the universe is more senseless rather then sensical as Borges states. 
                    Could this be the reason we turn to religion, because we can not truly obtain the answers we seek?
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    One question that I could not answer was whether or not the catalogue existed.
                    Afterall, if the library consisted of all books, surely there must be a book that explains the existence of the library.
                    Does this allude to the existence of an index that could help us understand this labyrinth we call the universe?
                    Could this index be seen as the true meaning of life within the infinite universe?
                    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Or is all this just another example of how we set ourselves on a wild-goose chase, in search of the meaning of the universe, in search of the meaning of life?
                    And when we hit a stone wall within this labyrinth of life, we turn towards our “unknown gods”. 
                    Could this be the aim of the library, to deceive us into chasing answers we will never find, chasing knowledge we will never obtain.
                    Reading books of other authors instead of writing our own.
