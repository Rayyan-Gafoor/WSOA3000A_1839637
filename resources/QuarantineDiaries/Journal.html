            So today I tried drugs for the first time.
            I thougt hey I'm isolated in my home and this is the safest enovironment for my to experiment.
            Well I was wrong, I know realise what Van Gogh saw when he painted The Starry Night. 
            I went into a state of psychosis.
            I heard people calling me, voices I've never heard before, I began to have hallucinations that seemed like they were stuck on repeat.
            That's when i realised that these hallucinations were the product of my memories, memories which I wish to forget.
            Have you ever tried so had to forget a thought, that the it just keeps coming back stronger. That is when 
            I heard it, the soothing sounds of the Winds.

            Today I woke up wondering what impression did I leave on everyone I've ever met?
            What kind of person do they see when they hear my name? Perhaps a different version of ourselves exists within the minds of others.
            Then I wondered does the version i have of myslef, show my true nature, or am I blinded by my own narcissistic tendencies.

            This might come across as dark, but... 
            I think Thanos had the right idea. Perhaps this virus has some good hidden between the bad.

            So, I had a dream, and it was kinda weird. By that I mean I was a Duck. Not like some super duck, no,
            just a plain duck. When I woke up thought I was still a duck, and walked to my living room not realising that i was actaully waddeling.
            Until I began to think out loud and instead of speaking english like a normal human being, I quacked. I sat there in silence asking myself WTF did I just do.

            But then I began to recall whow amazing it felt to be a duck: I mean i could walk on land, swim and fly...
            <br>I dont care what anyone says the DUCK is the Ultimate animal.

            <h3>The Third Person</h3>
            <h5>15/04/2020</h5>
            I'm beging to think being alone for so long is messing with my head. I had the most peculiar dream, in fact i dont know if you could even call it a dream.
            I remember falling asleep, but rigth after that i woke up, only to find my body lying, tossing and turning in the bed. I stood there trying to get my body to move at my command, but nothing.
            all I could do is watch and wait until i woke up. 
            I felt like a lost traveller, not knowing what to do, as if i have lost complete control. Then it occured to me how do we deal with the uncontrollable.
            Like how do i figure out what im supposed to do, what trail do I follow?
            But more importantly, how do I get back?

            <h3> Speed :)</h3>
            <h5>Day 2610 of lockdown... Just kidding- 16/04/2020</h5>
            So today I realised that I have a habit of timing myself regarding everything I do. Two of the most used methods I use is: Songs or, you guessed it, the Microwave.
            lets talk about the songs, I'm pretty sure im not the only one who gets in the shower and is like: "I Have exactly two songs to get done" or "I can take my time today lets have a concert and perform 10 songs".
            Now the Microwave... well thats where the weird comes in... At random moments i would just walk up to the microwave and set a timer and then try to get a certain number of task done before the beep. That includes going to the bathroom.

            <h3>The last Letter</h3>
            <h5>18/04/20</h5>
            As a war journalist and photographer my life is constantly at risk. Everytime, before I go onto the battlefield, I attempt to write a letter.
            At first the letters were meant for my mother, but even then I had nothing to say. How exatly to speak to someone after you have died. 
            Once my mother passed, I still attempted to write those letters. I would start off:
            <p>
                Dear... *blank*

            </p>
            And so they would remain. No final words. No one to read it. But funny enough its those empty letters, that silence that speaks to me the most.
            So if you ever wonder why there is a box full of empty letters, this is why. I've found that silence is the best conversation, even if it is just a goodbye.
