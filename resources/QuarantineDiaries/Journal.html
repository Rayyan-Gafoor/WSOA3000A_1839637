            <h3> The Singing Winds</h3>
            <h5>01/04/2020</h5>
            So today I tried drugs for the first time.
            i thougt hey I'm isolated in my home and this is the safest enovironment for my to experiment.
            Well I was wrong, I know realise what Van Gogh saw when he painted The Starry Night. 
            I went into a state of psychosis.
            I heard people calling me, voices I've never heard before, I began to have hallucinations that seemed like they were stuck on repeat.
            That's when i realised that these hallucinations were the product of my memories, memories which I wish to forget.
            Have you ever tried so had to forget a thought, that the it just keeps coming back stronger. That is when 
            I heard it, the soothing sounds of the Winds.

            <h3>The Others</h3>
            <h5>05/04/2020</h5>
            Today I woke up wondering what impression did I leave on everyone I've ever met?
            What kind of person do they see when they hear my name? Perhaps a different version of ourselves exists within the minds of others.
            Then I wondered does the version i have of myslef, show my true nature, or am I blinded by my own narcissistic tendencies.

            <h3>The Snap...</h3>
            <h5>06/04/2020</h5>
            This might come across as dark, but... 
            I think Thanos had the right idea. Perhaps this virus has some good hidden between the bad.

            <h3>The Ultimate</h3>
            <h5>09/04/2020</h5>
            So, I had a dream, and it was kinda weird. By that I mean I was a Duck. Not like some super duck, no,
            just a plain duck. When I woke up thought I was still a duck, and walked to my living room not realising that i was actaully waddeling.
            Until I began to think out loud and instead of speaking english like a normal human being, I quacked. I sat there in silence asking myself WTF did I just do.

            But then I began to recall whow amazing it felt to be a duck: I mean i could walk on land, swim and fly...
            <br>I dont care what anyone says the DUCK is the Ultimate animal.
