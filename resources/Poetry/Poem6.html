                   What she saw was amazing<br>
                   What she felt was love<br>
                   What she was meant to be<br>
                   Was a poem of beauty
                </p>
                <p>
                    She wanted to be her owen<br>
                    Knight in shining armour,<br>
                    Her own King<br>
                    Her own everything
                </p>
                <p>
                    BUT
                </p>
                <p>
                    Society had different plans<br>
                    for Her...<br>
                    And Like most who came before<br>
                    She fell victim to Society
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now you see<br>
                    its really sucks<br>
                    that she could'nt be<br>
                    what she always wanted to be
                </p>
                <p>
                    she was never ugly<br>
                    Society was the ugly one<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now all she sees<br>
                    is a feak<br>
                    All she feels<br>
                    is Hate
                </p>
                <p> 
                    R.I.P.<br>
                    To the Beautiful Poem<br>
                    That will never be...
                </p>
