                <p>
                    Twenty six hundered songs, poems and letters gone wrong.<br>
                    Things i wrote all in your name, I guess you'll never know.<br>
                    You'll never know this pain.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twenty 6 thousand lies, things I've said, never said why...<br>
                    I chose to keep it all deep inside, kept all those thought I had,<br>
                    Every single One still trapped in my mind.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twenty six hundered days, As well as nights, I see your face.<br>
                    But those Three Words I never say, every chance i got,<br>
                    I threw them all away.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twenty 6 thousand hours, the time I've spent locked in my tower<br>
                    Trpped in this self-inflicted loneliness, thinking about you<br>
                    I'm left starring at the stars, and just another lonely Moon.<br>
