            <h1>My War Journal</h1>

            <p>
                My Journey as War journalist, has thought me many lessons, I've seen pain, I've seen death, I've seen hate and fear...but more importantly, I Have Seen Hope.
                These Enteries do not only speak about the physical wars and my experience with them, but also about the wars I fight within myself.

                        <h1>My First War</h1>
                        They say you always remember your first, well they are right.
                        On my first day at war, I was joined by three other journalist. I was excited, to be honest it felt like I was going on an adventure.
                        It all felt like a movie, like I was reliving my favourite game.
                        In the begining everything felt calm, but then everything suddenly changed almost as fast as I could say: "Shit". Stranded within a cloud of dust, I heard the distant screaming of the otheres.
                        It was an attack by the opposing force. Confused, I had no idea what to do., so I ran, not knowing where I was running too.
                        And then, Nothing... I had been knocked out.

                        <h1>A Life Worth Living</h1>
                        After a few days of being confined against our will, days that seemed like ages of agony and suffering,
                        I finally felt like I was ready to give up. To this day I still have no idea why I did not.
                        Could it have been the glory and fame that awaited me back home that motivated me,
                        afterall amoung some journalist it is considered as a better motivator than the story itself.
                         All I knew was that at this point, I was willing to kill, if it meant my survival.

                        <h1> The Act That Haunts</h1>
                        As a journalist, I Spent most of my time questioning soldiers, one particular question I never thought I'd find myself sitting in the end of being was:
                        "How does it feel to take a life?". I always wondered how it had affected time, how they got to the point of actually going through with the kill.
                        How do they carry that weight of having the burden of taking a life.
                        Some of them claimed to have felt nothing, but there eyes always tell a different story.
                        Some suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other side-effects. Then you get the ones that just smirk off at the question, giving of the coldest aura I have ever felt,
                        do they enjoy this act?
