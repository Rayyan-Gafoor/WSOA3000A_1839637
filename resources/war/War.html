                    They say you always remember your first, well they are right.
                    On my first day at war, I was joined by three other journalist. I was excited, to be honest it felt like I was going on an adventure.
                    It all felt like a movie, like I was reliving my favourite game.
                    In the begining everything felt calm, but then everything suddenly changed almost as fast as I could say: "Shit". Stranded within a cloud of dust, I heard the distant screaming of the otheres.
                    It was an attack by the opposing force. Confused, I had no idea what to do., so I ran, not knowing where I was running too.
                    And then, Nothing... I had been knocked out.
