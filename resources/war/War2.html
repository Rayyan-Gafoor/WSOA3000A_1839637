                    A Life Worth Living
                </h1>
                <p>
                    After a few days of being confined against our will, days that seemed like ages of agony and suffering,
                    I finally felt like I was ready to give up. To this day I still have no idea why I did not. Could it have been the glory and fame that awaited me back home that motivated me,
                    afterall amoung some journalist it is considered as a better motivator than the story itself. All I knew was that at this point, I was willing to kill, if it meant my survival. 
                </p>
                <P>
                    I had learned the guards patrol routes, estimating the times, using only but the fraction of light that I recieved from the hole.
                    I was to strike at the second on of them made there way into my cell. Using a small rock I had fashioned into a dull arrow point, days of continuosly grinding,
                    I was finallly ready. I patiently waited for the right opportunity to arise. Then it happened.
                    
                </P>
                <p>
                    At the peak of midnight, a fight broke out. I immediatly thought that the army we were accompanied by had finally come for us.
                    My heart began to race. But then I heard the voices, It was not the amry, no it was rebel forces. One of them ran pass my cell.
                    I called out for help, he hesitated at first, he had a look on his face, a look that scared the living shit out of me. For a second
                    I thought, "do I really want this guy to open this cell?". After a while he turned towards my cell and opened it, all I could think about was:
                    "I was ready to kill one of them, and I am prepared to kill him given the right reason".
                    But no, in the most broken form of english he told me to run, I immediatly thought about the other journalist.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    I walked up to her cell, and what I saw still haunts me to this day. For a moment it was like reality hit me, everything around went blank, the gunshot, the screaming, I heard none of it.
                    Why? was all I could bring myself to say. Its funny how life works, the one who had everything waiting for her back home, gone, while I stand here compelety frozen.
                    The urge for me to kill, just grew stronger, and instead of running, like I was told to, I stayed.
                </p>
