                    They say you always remember your first, well they are right.
                    On my first day at war, I was joined by three other journalist. I was excited, to be honest it felt like I was going on an adventure.
                    It all felt like a movie, like I was reliving my favourite game.
                    In the begining everything felt calm, but then everything suddenly changed almost as fast as I could say: "Shit". Stranded within a cloud of dust, I heard the distant screaming of the otheres.
                    It was an attack by the opposing force. Confused, I had no idea what to do., so I ran, not knowing where I was running too.
                    And then, Nothing... I had been knocked out.

                    I woke to the taste of dirt in my mouth. I had no idea where I was or how long I have been asleep.
                    I asked myself, why and how the fu*k I would put myself in this situation.
                    I was scared, trapped in a dark room, which recieved just enough light to see what was close to you.
                    I heard a voice from not far from me, but I couldn't see who it was.
                    But I recognised the voice. It was one of the other journalists. She sounded just as scared as me if not more.

                    She told me about her life back home, her family, her friends and she couldn't stop talking about her little brother.
                    And then, she cried, saying over and over that she never wants to do this again.
                    That's when I thought about myself. Was this all worth, did I really have much to go back to.
                    You see unlike her, I had no one waiting for me back home. Just as I am now, I was alone even at there.
                    While she contemplated about how she had put her family in such a state of constant worry, I sat there wondering do I have something to live for.
