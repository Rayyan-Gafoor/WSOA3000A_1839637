                    The Act That Haunts
                </h1>
                <p>
                    As a journalist, I Spent most of my time questioning soldiers, one particular question I never thought I'd find myself sitting in the end of being was:
                    "How does it feel to take a life?". I always wondered how it had affected time, how they got to the point of actually going through with the kill.
                    How do they carry that weight of having the burden of taking a life.
                    Some of them claimed to have felt nothing, but there eyes always tell a different story.
                    Some suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other side-effects. Then you get the ones that just smirk off at the question, giving of the coldest aura I have ever felt,
                    do they enjoy this act?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That night I finally understood some part of each soldier. They claimed when they on the battlefield, religion does not exist,
                    it just you and the enemy, kill of be killed. For a while I would see how they would joke about taking a life, to take their fear and turn it into something ammusing.
                    Could this be there coping mechanism. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I killed a man that night, but at the moment I did not see him as a man, I did not see him as a human.
                    No, I saw him as a target, as my "prey". I ran towards him, usingthe knife given to me by the rescuer, I stab him straight in the neck.
                    And not long after, it was like the kill switch was turned off. What had I done,  I thought I was prepared, I was prepared, so what is this feeling?
                    Within an instant, he went from prey to a person. He could of had a family, a life outside of this war. Afterall he too was just another soldier obeying orders.
                    How do they do this, how do they feel when they go back home, and have to transition into a new role?
                    This is an answer I am still searching for, an answer to an act that could haunt me forever.
