                <h1>Pre-digital Geographies</h1>
                <p>
                This blog will once again cover the paper, "Towards a study of information geographies ", wriiten by Mark Graham et al's.
                We will be looking at the difference in geographies before and after the information revolution. How information was/is collected, controlled and used. 
                How the change in geogrphy was brought about and the main causes of this changed.

                <h2>Pre-Digital Geographies</h2>
                <p>
                    When I was younger, my mother always used to bring me old books whenever she could. Most of them had missing/ ruined pages, leaving me in suspense and partly sad.
                    I alwasy tried to reimagine and fill in these missing pieces. When I read "As we may think" by Vannevar Bush, it had become clear, why such precious information/ stories could not all be saved.
                    Enormose amounts of data could not be stored and preserved.
                    Today, we have the internet, that can always help fill in those missing pieces. But of course also there has to be some information that has even been lost to them. Sometime when I'm out in the field following soldiers into the battleflied, I'd find more books between all the rubble.
                    Sometimes with the help of the internet I can restore them, other times I'm not so lucky.

                     <h3>Mediums of storing data</h3>
                     In the past, the techonology necessary for storing data was not affordable. Therefore information was both scarce and geographically static.
                     Only a select few were responsible for preserving information. The most common ways of storing information was writting in books.
                     Great Libraries were formed in order to help share and further preserve this knowlegde. Tools were invented in order to further aid the cause.
                     Slowly allowing taking a step forward towards large-scale data presavation. Althpough both preserving and obtaining information required skill,
                     which many at the lacked. Take Epyptian literature for example: Hieroglyphics and hieratic scripts were used to write. Not everyone had the skill required to carve them.

                     <h3>Places of high Information Geographies</h3>
                    Most methods rendered the information it held immobile and geographically static. The methods made it almost impossible to collect and share data.
                    They required skill which took sometime to master. The question where was all this build up of information taking place.
                    Throughout history these places were seen as learning institutions.
                    When we look at the Anglo-saxon history and culture, this just provides more evidence.
                    Monasteries could be found across the entire country. They were seen as a religious and stable learning environments during this time.
                    Although most of the learning, constantly remained confined within the walls of these places. The only means of knowlegdebeing spread form these places were through pilgrims and other travlers that sort shelter.

                     The monks of these monasteries had certain roles and obligations:
                     <ul>
                         <li>First they had the responsibility of maintaining the monasteries.</li>
                         <li>To preserve books of knowlegde and religion, hand copying and painting in monastic scriptorium. </li>
                         <li>To store and preserve books of knowlegde in the monastic libraries</li>
                     </ul>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                     <h4>Rise of the Universisties</h4>
                     Today they are seen as the key to mordern education. But what is the history of this place of concentrated knowlegde.
                     Before univerties there were higher educational institutions that consisted of researchers. While they were nkt conducting research they would teach.
                     Aside form these institutions, there were also libraries, in which pupils would gather and are thought by an individual. Although something that aided to the embedment of information, was the fact that only a select few were granted this privilege of learning.
                     One could find more developing places and scholarship throughout specific regions, inducting more and more students.
                     Evantually the Musaeum was founded, which included the great Library of Alexandria. This institution brought information and knowlegde from all corners of the globe.
                     One could say that it functioned as one large univerty of the world. Once it was established that education was the key to ones future, countries all over the world began establishing learning institutions, each using different methods of teaching and knowlegde.

                        <h5>Other places of high information geographies</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Libraries</li>
                            <li> Museums</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                Even today Universisties are a centre of highly concentrated information geographies, but also only available to the few.

                        <h3>Participation</h3>
                        <h4>Gender stereotyping, Some how this little bugger always find his ways in :)</h4>
                        I'm pretty most of us has heard the phrase: "This is a man's world", well this is one of the first staggering component of information geography.
                        Most womwn werenot allowed to particicpate in learning institutions, in fact it was frowned upon society to do so. If we had to look at the women of ancient Greece for example.
                        We know very little of these women as a whole, this actually just shows how information geographies were mostly fixiated on the male conter parts.
                        These women were not generally not allowed/given formal education, although men were. However there is little evidence of some women reading and writting.
                        One of these women is Aspasia, who lived in Athens, and was very well-educated. Although she has always lived the shadow of her partner Pericles.

                        Side note: if you wondering why im writing about Greece, it probably because I've been replaying Assassins Creed Odyssey.

                    <h4>Having the Skills and Wealth</h4>
                    As we've seen in previosly in this article, only a select few were allowed to be educated, why?
                    Well in most cases those allowed to enter these institutions had to be of noble blood and of course have the wealth necessary for the education (lol something never change).
                    Other times pupils just did not have what it takes to be a scholar, and I guess that's just another sad part of life.
