                This is a standard break down of my character's personality
                and the situations and logic behind the development of her personality.

                    Motivation
                </h2>
                Throughout my character's childhood she has always felt like she was on her own.
                Her mother never had free time to spend with her, between juggling three jobs. Although her mother always made sure that she came first,
                and always tried to provide her with the best. At the age of 17 Zariyah lost her mother due to cancer.
                Thus leaving her completely alone. It was then when she bagan to have trust issues and pushing everyone who came into her life away.

            <p>
                Determined to make a life for herself Zariyah had graduated from highschool she moved on to study. Remebering all the stories her mother used to tell
                her regarding her father, she decided to study history. She became obessed with the past and the people from it. Zariyah went on to become well known amongst her peers and professors.
                She was then given the oppotunity to travel and finally see what shes been reading in books all these years. While on her travels, she realised that despite knowing wha she wants 
                in life, she never really found her purpose. She had met thousands of people all from diffrent cultures and religions, but none ever made sense to her.
                She then set herself own a path of self-discovery, with the intention of finally finding something worth believing in.
