        <h1>Character Rationale</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                This is a standard break down of my character's personality
                and the situations and logic behind the development of her personality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zariyah is a 24 year old women living in the city of johannesburg. As the process of this project continues we will see her character evovle.
                She is designed to be a dynamic character who's personality changes over time as she begins discover herself.
                She is bought the protagonist and antagonist in her life, this will be seen through her thought process, and preventing herself from reaching her goal to early in life.

                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                Throughout my character's childhood she has always felt like she was on her own.
                Her mother never had free time to spend with her, between juggling three jobs. Although her mother always made sure that she came first,
                and always tried to provide her with the best. At the age of 17 Zariyah lost her mother due to cancer.
                Thus leaving her completely alone. It was then when she bagan to have trust issues and pushing everyone who came into her life away.
                She doesn't attempt to hold onto any kind of memories that makes her feel attached to anything or anyone.

            </p>
            <p>
                Determined to make a life for herself Zariyah had graduated from highschool she moved on to study. Remebering all the stories her mother used to tell
                her regarding her father, she decided to study history. She became obessed with the past and the people from it. Zariyah went on to become well known amongst her peers and professors.
                She was then given the oppotunity to travel and finally see what shes been reading in books all these years. While on her travels, she realised that despite knowing wha she wants 
                in life, she never really found her purpose. She had met thousands of people all from diffrent cultures and religions, but none ever made sense to her.
                She then set herself own a path of self-discovery, with the intention of finally finding something worth believing in.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Actions</h2>
                This section will dicuss how the character acts and why.
            </p>
            <P>Zariyah has many unsual habbits that make her stand out from the norms of this world. She often leaves thousands of sticky notes all over her house,
                some have shorts notes on others are just blank. Throughout the year she collects items from her travels and from the people she meets. This includes writting there names in her journal.
                At the end of the year she has a bonfire and recalls on all these items, and then finally throwing them in to burn. The wierdest habit or perhaps the most dangerous,
                she would often try to find the highest place for her to sit and think. She belives she needs to see things from a different point of view and sitting on top of the roof or tree helps her see this clear.
                Another aannoying habit she has is never standing still, when you have to talk to her she often moves around in cirlces of move abck and forward, until someone points it out.
            </P>
            <p>
                Because of her childhood Zariyah has alwaysed questsioned everything. She has never been one to accept things as they come. Before acting she always analyises the situations and never rushes into anything.
                Before you act you need to think, But before you can think you need to read, these are the words she lives by.
                Because of this as well as her intovert personality she is a good listener. Always observing from the sidelines taking mentals notes. Dont get it rong she does and I mean always has awkward social interactions when coming into contact with others.
            </p>
            <p> When she becomes nervous she tends to isolate herself even further, she attempts to tackle what ever is on her mind all by herself and refuses to ask or accept help.
                When she stumbles upon problems she can not solve she turns to her books to escape from the world. Although this does not make her forget about her problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When she becomes sad she turns towards art for comfort. She would never look for comfort in the arms of another, infact she has never needed anyone to comfort her. 
                She believes heerself to be self-sufficient.
                From a young age she has found that art helps her cope with her emotions better then anything else. From poetry to paintings she word drown her sorrows.
                She tends to take on the same actions when she becomes angry.
            </p>
            <p> These actions taken due her emotions will slowly change over time</p>

                <h2>Inner Conflicts</h2>
                When we think of war, we almost never think about the photographer that make it possible for us to see what its like.
                Because of this Zariyah has often had to deal with her trauma with the help of others. She struggles with the harm done to her conscience.
                The dark stain left on her moral compass, caused by all the acts of war she has seen, and not being able to intervene in any of it. 
                This has left her with a memory she wishes to forget, a past she wishes she never had. This has affected her her in many arts of her life.

            </p>
            <p>
                Other inner conflicts she finds herself facing are:
                <ul>
                    <li>

            </p>

    Keep in mind that this will change over time.
