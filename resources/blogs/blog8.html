            <p>
                This is a standard break down of my character's personality
                and the situations and logic behind the development of her personality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zariyah is a 24 year old women living in the city of johannesburg. As the process of this project continues we will see her character evovle.
                She is designed to be a dynamic character who's personality changes over time as she begins discover herself.

                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                Throughout my character's childhood she has always felt like she was on her own.
                Her mother never had free time to spend with her, between juggling three jobs. Although her mother always made sure that she came first,
                and always tried to provide her with the best. At the age of 17 Zariyah lost her mother due to cancer.
                Thus leaving her completely alone. It was then when she bagan to have trust issues and pushing everyone who came into her life away.

            </p>
            <p>
                Determined to make a life for herself Zariyah had graduated from highschool she moved on to study. Remebering all the stories her mother used to tell
                her regarding her father, she decided to study history. She became obessed with the past and the people from it. Zariyah went on to become well known amongst her peers and professors.
                She was then given the oppotunity to travel and finally see what shes been reading in books all these years. While on her travels, she realised that despite knowing wha she wants 
                in life, she never really found her purpose. She had met thousands of people all from diffrent cultures and religions, but none ever made sense to her.
                She then set herself own a path of self-discovery, with the intention of finally finding something worth believing in.

                <h2>Actions</h2>
                This section will dicuss how the character acts and why.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of her childhood Zariyah has alwaysed questsioned everything. She has never been one to accept things as they come. Before acting she always analyises the situations and never rushes into anything.
                Before you act you need to think, But before you can think you need to read, these are the words she lives by.
                Because of this as well as her intovert personality she is a good listener. Always observing from the sidelines taking mentals notes. 
            </p>
            <p> When she becomes nervous she tends to isolate herself even further, she attempts to tackle what ever is on her mind all by herself and refuses to ask or accept help.
                When she stumbles upon problems she can not solve she turns to her books to escape from the world. Although this does not make her forget about her problems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When she becomes sad she turns towards art for comfort. She would never look for comfort in the arms of another, infact she has never needed anyone to comfort her. 
                She believes heerself to be self-sufficient.
                From a young age she has found that art helps her cope with her emotions better then anything else. From poetry to paintings she word drown her sorrows.
                She tends to take on the same actions when she becomes angry.
            </p>
            <p> These actions taken due her emotions will slowly change over time</p>
