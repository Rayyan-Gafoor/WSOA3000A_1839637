                    <h1>The Medium is The Message</h1>
                    <p>
                        Honestly this is likely one of the most difficult readings I've ever tried to analyse.
                        It took me a while to understand what he actually trying to say. Although I am pretty sure I dont have a complete undertsanding of the actual meaning.
                        Throughout the ages we have always been drawn to the media and the methods used to convey messages. These methods as well as the forms of media
                        have evolved greatly, compared to the past. From print to digital, each medium holding its own unique characteristics.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium-
                        that is, of any extension of ourselves- result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairsby each extension of ourselves,
                        or by any new technology."- Marshall McLuhan
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        When looking at the paper written by Marshall McLuhan, I've walked away with a couple of things in mind:
                        <li>
                            The Medium in which we experience messages greatly effect us, the way we undertsand, percieve, as well as our interest in the message itself.
                            I know for fact that this is true. This statement is proved almost everyday around us. Take me for example:
                            <P>
                                I've alwaysed struggled to focus in a class. At first I thought, hey, maybe im just not interested in this. But this was not the case.
                                In highschool I had this teacher, who thought me history. Everyday we'd go through the same routine:
                                <p>
                                    We would enter the class room and we would be greeted with a bored full of notes to take down.
                                    She'd get up from her desk and tell us to write it down, and that was it. No interaction with the class what so ever.
                                </p>
                                For a while, questioned my love for history. I considered changing subjects. But then one day, we enetered the class, and there were no notes.
                                We had a completely different teacher. His teaching methods were totally different form hers. And slowly but surely, my love for history was reignited.
                            </P>
                            The way he passed on the message changed everything. And that the thing, we are capativated by the new and improved was of conveying messages. Leaving one to think:
                            Is what makes the medium so significant, rather than the actual message?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Secondly, the medium itself can be seen as the message. 
                            <p>
                                The medium assissts with both learning and percieving the truth. It can help change the truth behind something.
                                In todays age we have the ability to edit videos and pictures which causes us to reconsider what we believe. In the past, recored evidence was consired the absolute truth.
                                I mean if we could see it happening it must be true, right? 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another example would be the propaganda seen in different countries, especially countries at war.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The medium is forever changing, and with it, the truth is continuesly at risk of being altered. The greater the medium, the greater the affect it will have on the message.
                        In the end we are left with only one question:
                        <p>
                            Which is more important, the Medium or the Message?
                        </p>
