                The Cyberspace, The Home Away From Home.
            </h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    As a world we are all going through something at this point. Trapped within a place we once considered a safe haven,
                    now the very place that allows our own thoughts to consume us. How do we deal with this? Well, most of us already have a way to escape,
                    some of us are only recently being consumed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this whole lockdown, I have almost completely immersed myself into the internet.
                    As the days passed, I became more and more consumed by this endless rabbit whole. It has become one of the most important spaces in my life (not that I had much of a life before).
                    The virtual community has become my primary source of entertainment. My or rather our way of escaping this now called hell hole of a home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The one place that has everything I need, be it information, gaming, music or something that has never really existed in the real world, my social life.
                    I began to think about how exactly the internet has helped reshaped/ form the culture of todays generation.
                    Afterall, do we we even have lives outside this Cyberspace, that we've grown so attached too. It has become both a convenience and a nuisance in our lives.
                    The internet did not help reshaped our lives, no , rather it has become it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not get me wrong, there are those who live outside the cyberspace, but this is not about them.
                    We are looking at those wo have wondered so deep down the rabbit hole, that they cant see the light.
                    I know i am a victim, do you? I mean take a look at your lives now, this lcokdown will help prove wether or not you are.
                    We've been been living through the internet all day everyday. We shop, socialise, learn, and dare I say even fall in love.
                    What the ever happend to the days of writting letters. We've become "Internet Zombies", who have lost the connection with reality, and human interaction.
                    Ever since the birth of the internet, we have always seen our rather blinded ourselves to only see the good.
                    But what about the bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Lee Siegel, who wrote : "the internet is reshaping our thoughts about everything". And as our live were reshaped the internet grew due to the changes both in society and our culture.
                    As someone who was raised by a mother who would do everything to protect her daughter, I was never allowed to be part of any form of social media. But once I had it, i became obbesed.
                    My whole life revovled around the media. Everything I done was influenced by the ineternet, the way I dressed, talked or what my interest were. 
                </p>

                    The internet itself has changed, from something once known as ARPANET to the World Wide Web. From sending short messages bewteen two terminals. Now the embodiment of the library of Babel. The internet is the one of the main sources of information.

                <p>
                    The internet changed almost everything about human life. The we handlesd business, Healthcare, The way we ran our educational systems, the way we interacted with others.
                    The internet became the main source of social evolution. But with the marvel comes the sisnister acts behind it, such as:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                                The communication of misinformation. In the past and even today, the internet is used as a platform of propaganda.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The internet leave you more exposed and vulnarable if you are not careful. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                Trolls and stalkers ...need I say more.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The great "Toxic Mirror" effect- as humans that interact on social media we are prone to be influenced by the so called influencers.
                            This means we are constantly exposed to information that creates negative opinions towards ourselves or others.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                                The Great Deep Web. Honestly I was always intrigued by this topic.The anti-social playground, sounds kinda perfect for me. I've read about some real skecthy things going on there,
                                But I've alwasy been afraid to check it out for myself.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Risk of Hackers.
                        </li>

                        The list could go on but I'll leave you were the responsiblity of that.
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    <h2>Culture shaped through the Internet</h2>

                    The internet effect the way live almost all the time, from our daily routines to our dirty habits.
                    The days of writting letters have been replaced by typing out messages (Fun fact sometimes I use racing pigeons to send messages to my friend).
                    Anyway, the internet also effect the way we think. They way we see society and experiences the things the world has too offer. 
                    But if you think about it, because we are so fixiated and influenced by what we see others doing, it is destroying our creativity, and our aestheics originality.

                <p>
                    I remember over hearing a group of people having a conversation about how the internet changed there lives, some of the things mention were quite interesting:
                    <uL>
                        <li>
                            "Finding love"- Honestly I don't know how to feel about this topic. Most of the time when i hear about this, the first thing that comes to mind is:
                            have your fallen for their internet persona, or have you fallen for who they truly are. Most people tend to be further blinded by this.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "learning somthing new"- When moving down the rabbit hole, one does tend to come across interesting topics and new information.
                            By the end of my adventure my head is completely filled with new information, which is the reason why my room is completely covered in notes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "The convenience"- As much as I hate to admit, I do tend to pirate a few thing here and there.
                            The internet has given us access to all kind of things free of charge. Another convenience would be having todays news well today. In the past one had to wait a day or two before hearing about Carole Baskins and her husband.
                            Or shopping which can now be done from the comfort of your living room. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "The Internet Bill"- Lets be honest, living in South Africa is expensive when it comes to data. One average I spend about R500 a week on data, don't jugde me.
                        </li>
                        
                    </uL>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, there is always a big influence that it has on our lives. It is becoming more and more important to us as we continue to grow attached.
                    despite the bad, the good does outway it. One of the best technological gifts given to us as humans,
                     its an ever growing technology that will continue to carry us into the future. The interne just makes life easier.
                     Bringing about globalization, it is the driving force of todays world.
