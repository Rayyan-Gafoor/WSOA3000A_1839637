                The Cyberspace, The Home Away From Home.
            </h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    As a world we are all going through something at this point. Trapped within a place we once considered a safe haven,
                    now the very place that allows our own thoughts to consume us. How do we deal with this? Well, most of us already have a way to escape,
                    some of us are only recently being consumed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this whole lockdown, I have almost completely immersed myslef into the internet.
                    As the days passed, I became more and more consumed by this endless rabbit whole. It has become one of the most important spaces in my life (not that I had much of a life before).
                    The virtual community has become my primary source of entertainment. My or rather our way of escaping this now called hell hole of a home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The one place that has everything I need, be it information, gaming, music or something that has never really existed in the real world, my social life.
                    I began to think about how exactly the internet has helped reshaped/ form the culture of todays generation.
                    Afterall, do we we even have lives outside this Cyberspace, that we've grown so attached too. It has become both a convenience and a nuisance in our lives.
                    The internet did not help reshaped our lives, no , rather it has become it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not get me wrong, there are those who live outside the cyberspace, but this is not about them.
                    We are looking at those wo have wondered so deep down the rabbit hole, that they cant see the light.
                    I know i am a victim, do you? I mean take a look at your lives now, this lcokdown will help prove wether or not you are.
                    We've been been living through the internet all day everyday. We shop, socialise, learn, and dare I say even fall in love.
                    What the ever happend to the days of writting letters. We've become "Internet Zombies", who have lost the connection with reality, and human interaction.
                    Ever since the birth of the internet, we have always seen our rather blinded ourselves to only see the good.
                    But what about the bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Lee Siegel, who wrote : "the internet is reshaping our thoughts about everything". And as our live were reshaped the internet grew due to the changes both in society and our culture.
                    As someone who was raised by a mother who would do everything to protect her daughter, I was never allowed to be part of any form of social media. But once I had it, i became obbesed.
                    My whole life revovled around the media. Everything I done was influenced by the ineternet, the way I dressed, talked or what my interest were.
