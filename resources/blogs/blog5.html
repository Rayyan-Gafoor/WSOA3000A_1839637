                UX versus Pyschology

                In order for one to successfully deisgn a good UI, which will allow for a better UX, one must first understand the pyschology behind the human mind.
                As an intovert I've actually tried studying these things in order to help me understand other people and see their perspective/views on certain issues or topics.
                Although this did not really work, esspecially in my realtionships... (you can't see my face but I'm cringing). Maybe I just tried to hard or maybe I began to use these pyschological phenomenon to manipulate others.
                And thats another important note: We should not use these things to manipulate our users, rather it should be used to act as a guide.
            </p>

                 When designing UI we need to consider the pyschology of attention. Knowing where and when to draw the users attention. 
                 Understanding the pyschology behind this will allow the designers to draw attention to where they want the users to go or to use certain options.
                 This is where another issue comes into play: having too many options. One of the basic rules of UI design is to provide simplicity and ease of use.

                 <blockquote>

                 </blockquote>
                 Users prefer systems that they can fimilarise themselves with faster. Having complex systmes will either prevent this from happening or the users will find it to be tedious.
                 A simpler system will allow the users to achieve their goals faster. Your aim as a designer should be to simplify the users journey.
                 Becomig fimiliar with the site will also lead to another pyschological phenomenon: The Mere-Exposure-Effect.
                 This effect can be best explained using the realtionship between two people (and yes, i have tried this before, and yes it worked to a certain extent):
                 consider person one, hwo happpens too bump into person two almost everyday. The mere exposure to person two inevitably makes person one see them as more attractive.
                 Which will eventually lead to a development of feelings. The same can be said for UI and UX, the more the user uses your website they wll develop a preference due to the fimilarity.

                Remember to be consistant within your design. Users will not be able to fimiliarise themselves with a design that constantly changes (i dont know about you but the staircase at Horgwarts still confuse to this day).
                
            </p>
            <p>
                According to researcg there are several other pyschological phenomenon that should be considered when designing UI:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Isolation Effect</li>
                    <p>
                        People are more likely to remember items that stand out from the crowd.( if you going to use this to get someone's attention, please make sure you dont embarress yourself in the process. And remember once you get their attention, consistancy is important, so be careful)
                        Appealing to the users nner child will help with this. Think of shapes, colours and sound to help achieve this.
                    </p>
                    <li>Aesthetic-Usabilty Effect</li>
                    <p>
                        Bascially the better your deign/theme the more poeple will tend to use it. This is because it give off the illusion that your site/system has no flaws ( Bascially social media and how they portray other females)
                        This is used commonly to manipulate users, which we trying to stay away from. Unless your site is actaully a great one then by all means go ahead, but remember we all hate a "Catfish".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You know how every child and most adults always want to push that red button, well this is it (we learn through the demon known as curiosity).
                        As humans we program ourselves while perform actions. When we get used to performing these actions and recieving certain reactions, we tend to memorise these experiences and patterns.
                        But again this can lead the manipulation of the mind, so be careful.

                Well I think thats enough of the do's and dont's when meeting or interacting with other humans, no wait thats wrong. I meant thats enough on UI and UX.
