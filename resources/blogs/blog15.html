                    <h2>Spiders of the Internet</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Internet is full of crawlers known as web robots. These bots are automated software that perform tasks across the internet.
                        These are normally simple and monotonous task, and are done much faster compared to what a human is capable of. They allow most search engines to function.
                        Most of these web bots are considered harmless, and actually help improve and reshape the internet to this day. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        History of Bots
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        World Wide Web Wanderer.<br>
                        In 1993,after the release of the NCSA Mosiac web browser, a programme was written with the function of traversing the Web and collect data from sites.
                        This programme was known as the World Wide Web Wanderer. Wanderer was used to generate an index, which potentially led to the first search engine. This index was known as the "Wandex".
                        But is this the true origins of these crawlers?
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alan Turing is known for his experiment that helped shape Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). Most of his researched revolved around one question: "Can machines think?".
                        Thus the experiment: The Turing Test. The idea behind this was to determine the difference between a human and a machine.
                        If their was no trace eveidence of the machine being different, it would was considered to be thinking.
                        Although, no machine has won, they are slowly becoming more and more human everyday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not long after, web bots became a norm, in fact they take up the majority of internet traffic to this day.
                    </p>
                    <h2> How web bots use Metadata</h2>
                    <p>
                        Bots are begining to mimic our interactions with the internet. And by doing so they are begining to appear more and more human.
                        For more into this topic see the following site: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18098790/data-craft-bots-society-social-media-metadata">Click Me</a>

                    <p>
                        In my opinion, they  are slowly taking over. From social media bots to search bots, They have a way of influencing us and our opinions.
                        They are responsible for the spread of almost every information we come across, including misinformation. Once again bringing into question the reliability of the medium (see previous post).
                        Most of the time users can't distinguish humans from bots. Some measures have been put into place to help with this.
                        These very same bots are then used in businesses and social media.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Somethings that I have noticed, about the people around me, is that when they come across a social media influencers account they almost immediatly look at the ammount of followers, and shortly after they would click the follow button.
                        They do this without knowning that there is a chance that most of those followers are bots. But because we only human, we are easily manipulated and therefore our opinions can easily be changed.

                    </p>
                    <h2>The Treat of Bots</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not all these crawlers creeping around the internet are harmless. In fact some bots are designed with a malicious intent.
                        With the sole purpose of secretly installing themselves on your device and perform malicious acts, from spamming to Deniak of Service attacks.
                        Other forms of attack bots include:

                            <li>
