            <h2>
                Toxic Power
            </h2>

            <blockquote>

            <p>
            I’ve been reading a lot of articles and short stories that revolve around knowledge.
            Somehow, I always end up asking myself the same question. Is Knowledge ‘toxic’. <br>
            We are familiar with the phrase that knowledge is power. And as humans we’ve stumbled upon the fact that power does indeed corrupt.<br>
            But does this mean that knowledge will inevitably lead to corruption. <br>
            As humans we have a deep and obsessive nature for curiosity.
            <br> But what happens when this curiosity leads to knowledge that could possibly lead to one’s own demise.<br>
            As seen in religious text as well, Adam and Eve fell victim to curiosity, leading to them being cast out of the Garden of Eden.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
            One way of how knowledge can be toxic and result in corruption, is when we tend to keep it all to ourselves.<br>
            But why do we do this? Keeping the knowledge gives us a sense of ‘power’ and control over those who are unaware of it.<br>
            This comes with the fear of being minuteand replaced by those who can understand it better. Either that of its simply because of ones own selfish desires.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            In the article, “ As We May Think”, written by Vannevar Bush. He speaks about the ways in which we can share knowledge, and how important it really is.<br>
            He continues by saying that we’ve lost so much knowledge over the years, and all this due to poor methods of communication.<br>
            Who knows where we would have stood as a race if we had not lost all that knowledge.<br>
            But I guess that’s just the side effect that comes with the corruption of knowledge. It tends to slow us down instead of helping us evolve.
            </p>
            <p>
            But what also makes knowledge so toxic, is the pursuit for it. We tend to drive ourselves insane, becoming obsessive over knowledge we are yet to obtain.<br>
            Not  everyone is capable of self control. And we tend to go to extreme measures just to have a glimpse of pandoras box. Take the Library of Babel for instance.<br>
            The librarians drove themselves crazy, all for the sake of one book, the ultimate form of knowledge.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
                "Humans invented the atom bomb but no mouse in the world would construct a mousetrap" ~<cite>Albert Einstein</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <br>

            <p>
            What happens once we have this knowledge? We use to find ways to belittle the next man that comes along.<br>
            We use it to create weapons against each other, instead of using it to help our race.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t get me wrong, knowledge does not always lead to corruption. 
                I guess in the end, it all depends on ones self-control and what you do with that knowledge.
