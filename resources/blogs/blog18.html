                       For years I have struggled with religion. People always say its never good to question your beliefs, but honestly I call bullshit.
                       Most of us are brought up into a life only knowing what we were told to know. We follows because we were thought to follow. When I was ten I realised that my mother had never forced her religion on to me.
                       Yet she was always the most religious person I knew. So one day, I decided to talk to her about her beliefs. She told me she has never questioned her faith in "Allah" (God), and that she never will.
                       For her, it was the not knowing that made her believe, somehow it made her faith even stronger. As for me, I continued to question everything. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against what people choose to believe in,
                       only the fact that they choose to follow blindly.

                        I honestly find this one of the most depressing qoutes ever. We are all capable of grasping the true nature of reality, yet we do not have the thinking capacity to do so.
                        And I cant blame anyone, there is not a single living being in this universe that does not have some kind of obstruction clouding their mind. And I still struggles, and so I decided to start a new journey.
                        A journey that I was not fimiliar with. I began looking at what truly captivates me, what I truly feel is worth believing in. And so,this is where it brought me:<br>
                        <h2> The STARS.</h2>
                       </p>
                       <p>
                       The Idea of this ever-expanding universe has always been the most interesting thing in this world for me. I always felt out of place, but looking up to the stars made me feel like I belonged, like I was destined for somthing greater.
                       On my journey, I was met with a New Age Belief: StarSeed, or as they are also known "Star People".  Born from a distant star, a descendant of a faraway light-body, a Starseed.
                       Advanced spritual being originating form distant plants, realms and universes, sent to earth with a different intent. There are many of them, and some of them choose to guide those that are lost. Helping them through the process of accension and awakening.
                       Others sent to help humans evolve as beings, but they are not all the same. There are different kinds of Starseeds, each with their own purpose and mission, some with even darker intents.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Here are some of the more popular and known types of Starseeds.
                        <ul>
                        <li>Sirian</li>
                        <li>Arcturian</li>
                        <li>Andromedan</li>
                        <li>Pleiadian</li>
                        <li>Feline</li>
                        <li>Maldek</li>
                        <li>Indigo</li>
                        <li>Lightworker</li>
                        <li>Orion</li>
                        <li>Lemurian and Atlantean</li>
                        <li>Avian and Blue Avian</li>
                        <li>Reptilian</li>
                       </ul>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         The whole concept is so vast yet so interesting, take your time to research about the stars, about our universe, about the Star People.
                         Maybe you are a lost soul, who has always dreamt of something greater, a greater purpose. But "Do not follow blindly", remember to question everything.
                         The truth is, that at any point in your life, you can expand into something great. Perhaps one day we could transcend the universe and become one with it all.
