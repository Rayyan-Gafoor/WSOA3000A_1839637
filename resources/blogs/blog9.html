           <h1>Information Geography</h1>
           <p>
               There is a new meaning to word Geography. When we think of information we inevitably think about knowledge,
               but what happens to the medium which this information travels in. Based on the areas where these mediums were found, they created a new represention of information. The geography of information.
               Across the world there is a great divide between the Northern and the Southern hemispheres. This divide is created from the geography of infomation.
               This digital divide is just another example of how we are all a defined by our so called digital shadows.
           </p>
           <P>
               Before the evolution of tecnology, info mation was scarce. Only the powerful had access to this great source of knowledge.
               And in turn the hording of this knowledge gave them more power. But as technology evovled one would think that this power would have been reduced.
               No, in fact this just encouraged the seperation of the rich world from the poor.
           </P>
           <p>
               <h3> The Birth of the Internet and the Access to Information</h3>
               The internet, The great bifrost of information. created by the powerful in order to expand there knowledge of this world.
               The very thoughts concieved by Vannevar Bush come to life, but was this truly what he imagine. The interent was thought to be the one thing that would erase the divison of of information.
               Even with the internet's existance, The great divide was still promonant, but why?
           </p>
           <p> <h3>The Factors that Affect Access to the Internet </h3>

                In the digital age the barriers that prevented most of us from access information was reduced, changing the geography of information, but still this was not enough.
                There was still a huge difference between the hyperconnected rich and the previously unconnected poor.
                As Mark Graham state, in many ways what we actually see in the geogrpahy, is the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.
                This statement has only been amplified by the increased growth of the digital world. Thus the first factor: The link between capital and information. 
                One example of this link would be having to pay to access certain articles online. Most of the time people attempt to avoid such actions, leaving them with no other choice but to use pre-dated forms of information
                such as libraries. As a historian I've learned that becuase of this Google doesn't always have what we need.
                The powerful still have control over the information we have access to.
           </p>
           <p>
                When we look at the cost of technology, it is one of the biggest contributors to the division we see.
                Most of the time third-world countires can not afford the technologies neseccary for the access to this information.
                Counteries can not afford the data rates that are offered to them, and this reduces their access to information significantly.
                But it's not all about connectivity. Even with the affordability of data, There is still a limited number of poeple who can afford the devices used to access the internet.

               <h3> Who Actaully Participates</h3>
                Another factor that conributes the geogrpahy of information would be the use of the internet. Who actually uses it.
                The barriers of participation has nothing to do with the access to internet.
                Despite having access to the ineternet most people choose not to use it as much. If we had to map internet domains most of them are registered to first-world countries. For instance when we take a look at wikipedia,
                most edits or posts are from first-world counteries. This could be due the conditions of participation such as the access to pre-dated/ prior knowledge. With the access to prior knowledge, voices form thrid-world countries are over powered by the first-world.

               <h3>To be continued</h3>
               Our world will always have this division for as long as power continues to corrupt the rich.
               I find this idea of information geogrpahy quite interesting, which is why I plan on looking further into it.
               I will also try to find links between the inequalities regarding information as well as how this the widening of the inequality continues to grow.
