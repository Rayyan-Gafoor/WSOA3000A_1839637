        <h1>AI</h1>
        <p>AI also called artificial intelligence is used to allow technology to learn from experiences and complete required tasks by reading and recognising large amounts of data.
        This allows machines to do human tasks and even more.
        AI has a pretty huge impact on society, though many does have polarised feelings on it.
        Some believe that AI is bad where it would steal jobs, have a 24 surveillance on us for the government or these robots would “Try to kill us”.
         Some believe it’s good where it could prevent accidents and solve problems for humans. 
        The misconception that media places on AI is that it is a robot that would think on its own and would turn on the human race while in actual fact AI machines are just given a specific task and does it based on its programming.
        </p>
        <p></p>Artificial Intelligence is divided in two categories such as weak AI and strong AI.
         Weak AI are only given one function/job, this would include video games or intelligent assistants within smart cell phones where you would ask a question and it would answer it to you.
          Strong AI tends to do human tasks, and example to this would be self-driving cars or an autopilot within a plane.
        </p>
          <p>There are endless applications for AI and can be applies in different industries and sectors. 
          AI goes as far being in your own cell phone where it would recommend certain advertisements to you based on what you searched for or what you’re interested in. 
          It is also applied in the finance industry where it would detect banking fraud by monitoring what the user is doing with their finances and accounts.
        </p>
        
          <h2>How Metadata use AI</h2>
                <p>
                In its simplest meaning meta-data is basically data that describes data. 
                Meta-data is categorised into 3 types – descriptive, structural and administrative. 
                Descriptive metadata describes the unique information of the data. Structural metadata describes how the data is structured. 
                Administrative metadata manages the data by providing information on how it is created. Applications to this would be Companies using metadata as tagging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metadata would use AI to reduce the effort as well as improve the quality of it. 
                    This would allow you to complete certain projects in a faster time period than if you had to do it manually.
                    With metadata and AI together, it would allow systems to learn as they work which can help improve results over time and eliminate all errors a human would make.
                </p>
                
        <h2>Dangers of AI</h2>
        <p>
            According to the article “Criminal Machine learning” Wu and Zhang’s (2016) approach followed up on the Lombroso’s approach. Lombroso’s approach is based on the fact that criminals were born as such, and they had psychological drives and distinct physical features. These features would include the shape of the jaw, the size of the eyes, the structure of the ears and the slope of the head. In the end it didn’t have a scientific basis.
        Wu and Zhang improved Lombroso’s by making use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) machine learning to find specific algorithms within a human face that would be linked to criminality. That was their first Mistake. They used a computer based algorithm because it would have no emotion, it would not judge based on age, race and religion. They would gather so called ID photos of criminals and non-criminals and make a conclusion based in how far the eyes are apart or the angle between the nose and the mouth. Criminals would have shorter distances between the inner corners of the eyes, smaller angles between the nose and the corners of the mouth, and higher curvature to the upper lip. This is already a problem because not all criminals would have the same facial features due to genetics and changing your facial expression.
        If this application of finding criminals would be applies then there would be so many implications and problems that would arise. Based on his/her facial structure, an innocent person would be accused of committing a crime. This basically means that all unattractive people would be guilty of criminality whilst all attractive people would be innocent.

        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>In Conclusion
        <p>
            Based on what was said there are both bad and good aspects regarding AI,
        but the question is does the good aspects outweigh the bad? In my opinion
