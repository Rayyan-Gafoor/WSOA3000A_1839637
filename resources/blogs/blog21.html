                        <h1>Space the final...Well you know this goes</h1>
                        <p>
                            From my new found belief interest "StarSeeds" to my childhood dream of becoming an "Inter-Galactic Space-Soldier", the cosmos has always been something I found truly fascinating.
                            As a child I always found myself overwhelmed with question about the unknown, what lies beyond the that big blue sky?
                            I could only dream about exploring our universe, discovering what celestial wonders lie in the beyond.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Below is what I like to call a portal to the universe, or atleast the little we already know.
                            Its amazing what lies out there, the wonders of space. Honestly speaking I believe in the existance of aliens.
                            In highschool I wrote a speech about the unievrse and other life and  guess what, the teacher failed me.
                            Even though she gave us the freedom of choosing our own topics, she said mine was ridiculous and goes against her religion.
                            Yep, thats right, I failed because what i spoke about went against someone's beliefs, even though had no mention or form of degrading any form of belief.
                            Only because of the mere fact that I said aliens exist. Or maybe its because of what I said afterwards, I always had this tendency to challenge my superiors.
                            I reponded to her by using something I heard Neil deGrasse Tyson use:"Claiing there is no other life in the universe is like scooping up some water, looking at the cup and claiming there are no whales in the ocean"
                            Anyway we not here to talk about me failing.<br>
                            Take a look at this NASA API: "Astronomy Picture of the Day"

                            <section class="NASA_API">
           
                                <h1> NASA API </h1>
                                Insert a date in the form : YYYY-MM-DD and watch the portal take you on a journey.<br>
                                 <input id="DateFromUser" type="text" placeholder="Enter Search DATE"/>
                                 
                                 <button id="Search">
                                     View Picture and Content
                                 </button>

                             </section>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also take a look at the image search provided by NASA below:
