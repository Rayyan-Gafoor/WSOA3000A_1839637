                        <h1>The Importance Of External Dependecies.</h1>
                        <h2>Discover The Cosmos</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hi there my fellow weirdos, Im sure you know my name, Zariyah, but I was recently told to always state who I am. Apperantly it will help me in my journey to enlightenment.
                            Please dont ask me why, because like you I'm lost and confused. Anyway lets see what we have today:<br>
                            So as a web designer I wanted to implement something interesting to my website, something that everyone can appreciate.
                            As you have noticed in my latest blogs, I've been captivated by the idea of the Cosmos. As a person, I suffer from not knowing my place in the universe, what my purpose is.
                            For awhile I considered myself to be lost, and so I wanted to create something for people like me. People that i looking to explore the unkown, to cross boundaries that mere mortals can not.
                            As an attempt to ahieve this, I implemented a basic NASA API: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day).<br>
                            Lets take a look at the details further below:<br>
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So for those of you that are still confused (don't worry about it, I might be just as confused as you when it comes to this), lets take a closer look at what an API is.
                            According to my understanding an API (application program interface) is a set of tools and protocols used to build applications using digital communication to transfer and collect data securely across a variety of platforms.
                            They help improve our websites and other applications, while getting rid of all those unnecessary steps involed in the developing process.
                            In fact with just the push of a button we have the ability to do this. When we do this not only are we making the site more interesting, but we are also creating a better and more meaningful user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What is the NASA APOD API:<br>
                            The API is used to return images and descriptions for those images. A new image is taken everyday and thus the name Astronomy Picture of the Day.
                            It does this by allowing the developer to access imagery and metadata, which is accessed through using an API key.
                            See the website below on what the API is :<br>
                            <iframe src="https://api.nasa.gov/" width="750" height="700"></iframe>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why Did I Choose This API:<br>
                            Honestly speaking, it speaks to me as person, and to my personality. I love everything about the Cosmos, everything from the "why" to the "wow that looks so amazing".
                            As a child I wanted to walk in my father's shoes, I wanted to be soldier, to be honest, this was the only real thing I knew about him. Perhaps thats what contributes to my state of being lost and constantly wandering, because I chose to follow someone I never knew.
                            But anyway, with the imagination I had back then, I did not just want to become any soldier, nope, I wanted to be an Inter-Galactic Space-Soldier. I wanted to see space, I wanted to explore it.
                            As an adult I now realise that is not completely possible. Being confined in Johannesburg these past few months made me realise that perhaps the purpose that I am searching for does not exist here, that I should look further.
                            So with the rebirth of my dream, I decided to implement this API.<br>

                            So this is for the lost, for the seekers and wanderers. Take a look at the API to get a step closer to exploring the universe.

                            <h2>Alternatives to creating the Illsuion of Interactvity</h2>
                            So basically before I decided on implementing this API, I had to do my research.
                            I wanted to find different ways of bring my website to life, making it feel almost as real as possible.
                            So I turned my vision towards javascript. OH, the endless possibilities. Anyway, as most of you have seen, I have two Journals and a Portfolio.
                            <lI>
                                Quarantine Journal- Just randoms thoughts I have had during the lockdown.
                            </lI>
                            <li>
                                War Journal- Documenting my experience as a war journalist.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Portfolio- A portfolio showing some of my work as a photography
                            </li>

                            So I asked myself, how can I make these two features more realistic, and increase user experience and interactvity.
                            Well I thought, hey it is a journal, so how about we make it act and feel like you reading from a journal, and create the Illsuion of turning pages.
                            Unfortunately, this was not done using an external dependency, although we did add a similar feature. In fact I am sure using an external dependency will help improve this.
                            Here is a list of external libraries one could use:<br>
                            <li>
                                jQuery
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Slick
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Glimmer.js
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Vue.js
                            </li>
                            Another alternative could be using a Cloud hosted Web services and API such as Pusher, to create and implement a real-time commenting system.
                        </p>

                            <h1>HTML implementation</h1>
                            <img src="html_implementation.png" alt="" srcset="" width="50%" height="50%">
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                Using a basic implementation of html, a user input is created to receive the date input in the form : YYYY-MM-DD<br>
                                Creating a search button is then use to initiate the javascript function.<br>
                                Using the img and div elements, an ID is used to identify each. These are the placeholders for where the data being received need to be stored
                            </p>
                            <h1>Javascript implementation</h1>
                            <img src="Java_implementation.png" alt="" srcset="" width="50%" height="50%">
                            <br><br>
                            <p>
                                The code starts off by creating an Event Listener, which is initiated as soon as the button implemented in the html file is "clicked".
                                When this happen, the input given by the user is then stored in the variable "userDate".
                                This variable is then used in the function "sendApiRequest"<br>
                                The sendApiRequest function is used to request the data needed using the Api key, and then appending the stored "userDate" variable at the end of the API key.
                                Once this data is then received it is stored in the variable "data".<br>
                                The "data" variable is used in the UseApiData function. This is basically used to display the data we have recieved onto our website.
                                In our case the data is the image source accompanied by the explanation for the image. 

                            </p>
                        </P>
                        <P>
                            Well thats it for my external dependency. Thank you guys so much, till we meet again.
                        </P>
