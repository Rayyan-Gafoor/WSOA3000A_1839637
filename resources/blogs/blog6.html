                Fire the main element responsible for the evolution of man.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sure we all know what fire is and what is capable of, but do we know where it comes from and why it exists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Billions of years ago there existed a planet made of only molten rock. This planet, well we know it as Earth. Even though there was lava, fire was nowhere to be found. I mean somthing had to be be missing, but what.
                After a few thousands of years the planet began to cool down, and thus the birth of earths great oceans. But something was different, something had emerged from it's depths.
                It was life, something that only earth is said to provide ( or so we believe). With life, came the release of oxygen. As life evolved plants began to grow, and eventually dominated the planet.
                And thus the ingredient needed to create fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                This new age was born of somthing destructive, with the strike of lighting and thunder the spark would light the way taking us into a new world, a world of fire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stephen Pyne once said that we are fire creatures from an iceage. After all there is nothing throughout history that best explains the existance of humans better than fire.
                With the birth of fire came the birth of the first civilisation. When the Homo Sapiens discovered fire, they were transformed. With this new ability of defending themselves, they could now do the hunting instead of being the hunted.
                Without fire they had not even the slightest chances of survival, they learned to depended on this desturctive trick of nature.

            </p>
            <p>
                "Animals hunt, Animals make tools, but only humans have mastered fire" Richard Wrangham, author of how cooking made us human.
                As time went by they learned not only to use fire to defend themselves,but also, they began expolring its destructive nature and learned how to cook.
                Once we mastered everything we could at the the time we left the animal kingdom behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cooked food contained more protein, more nutrients, which allowed our brains to develop, slowly allowing us to evovle, into the creatures we are today.
                We began to explore other aspects of the world, man began to hunt while the women began to gather and teach children about the ways of the new world.

                Fire gave birth to a new age, the age of metal...<br>
                With all the free time we had, we discovered minerals. We learned to melt down these minerals using fire, and not long after we discovered metal. With this metals we created tools, as well as weapons.
                Fire gave us a chance to explore new worlds but in the process we began to destroy our own.

                Throughout history fire has always been at our sides, a faithful companian. In the begining it provided us wuth food, heat, survival, but in the end just as all humans, we fell victim to curiosisty.
                We began pushing the limits of this unpredictbable element. We took this flame, this destructive tool, and tried to use it to bend the world to our will. And for awhile it did.
                Fire helped transform everything natural, everything normal into the extraordinary. But this beauty that blinded us all did not last forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we were to look straight into the heart of war, we would find fire burning bright within the core. The disocovery of metal opened doors for all kinds of technology, and thus it is said that fire is the first product of our desire for immortality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without fire there wouldn't be the transformation of warefare by the introduction of gunpowder. We turned against each other using the very thing that allowed us to evovle, to destroy us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life on earth was forced to deal and live with the monster it had created. Fire has taken many lives throughout history. Many great cities haven fallen due to its destructive power such as Rome, York, Moscow but the worst one by my standereds, the Great Fire of London.
                The people lost everything, we were pushed back as a species, but not all hope was lost.

            <p>
                Out of the ashes something new was born. It gave humans a second chance. Fire allowed us to create the modern world with the ashes of our past. And from these new ashes came the industrial age, the age of engineers.
                The age of science.

                But thats a story for another day.

                P.S. - I'm really sorry to leave you in suspense.
