                        <h1>Important moments in the history of the WWW.</h1>
                        <p>
                            <h2>Tim Berners-Lee: The Proposal of Information Management.</h2>
                            Tim founded and is on the board of the WWW Fondation. While being employed at CERN, he invented the WWW in 1989.
                            At the time, this proposal was brought to CERN to persuade them into thinking that the managemnet system is in their best interest.
                            The proposal originally discussed the managemnet of data regarding experiments at CERN. Discussing the advantages of the system while also confronting
                            currenting issues such as the loss of data and access to data. It introduces or rather envisions the idea of interlinked systems of information, which would be accessed to browsers. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Tim submitted this proposal, his boss, Mike Sendall, he commented that it was "vague but exciting".
                            The proposal existed for a while before becoming a reality. Dispite not being accepted immediatly, Tim was allowed to work on his invention.
                            Within a months time the 3 fundamental technologies for WWW were written:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    HyperText Markup Language (HTML):<br>
                                    This is the standard markupp language used to write documents (pages) meant to be displayed in a web browser. Each page containing hyperlinks to other pages.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):<br>
                                    This is a sequence of characters used to identify resources on a network. There are two types of URI's:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            URLs
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            URNs
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):<br>
                                    This is a protocol used to transfer data over the WWW, allowing for communication between different systems.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of the 1990, Tim had succesfully created the first web page including the Web page browser and Web Server.
                            In 1991 this new web based environment was introduced to the public, and thus the WEB was Born.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h2>The Web Is Born</h2>
                            In August 1991, the world was introduced to one of mankinds greatest technologies to date. The World Wide Web.
                            The web became a service on the internet for the general public, when Tim published the very first website. The website contained details on the W3 project.

                            <h2>Browers Development</h2>
                            Web browers connect internet users through out the world. In 1990 The first web browers was created, the WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus.
                            Nexus served both as a brower and editor, used to create and browse web pages. By the end of 1992 multiple browsers had been developed. The rate of developed
                            increased rapidly over the years while new features were constantly added. Although this was not the end. This led to the first browser wars. The first browser wars led to the
                            developement of Internet Explorer, which was released in 1995. Thus the battle between Microsoft and Netscape for WWW dominance began. Honestly I find the thought of this type of war quite interesting.
                            It's funny how we as humans can create wars with virtually anything. In the end Internet Explorer won the first browser war. Although this victory was short lived, due to Google's Chrome Browser.

                            <h2>Google</h2>
                            The last significant moments for me, is the birth of Google. 
                            <iframe src="https://about.google/our-story/" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
                        </P>
                        <p>
                            Each of these moments have led to what we know as the internet today. Where would we have been if it were not for these moments, these people, these wars.
                            They all led to the developement of the WWW. Allowing us, pushing us to go further. It's kind of like life, like fire, we need to be pushed in order to surpass of limits.
                            The browser wars played a key role in this, and it is still continuing to do so. I guess some wars do result in something good.
