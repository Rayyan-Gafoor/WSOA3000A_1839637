                    Zariyah.
                <br>
                Born 29 October 1996, in Afaganistan. Raised in multiple countries, by her single mother.
                She made a life for her in South Africa, although she does travel a lot.
                As a child of war, Zariyah has become obssesed with idea of it as well as history.
                Thus resulting in her occupation has a historian and war photographer.

                    As a result from moving a lot during her childhood, she never really made any friends.
                    This led to a life of introversy. Even as an adult she struggles to socialise and would rather prefer her own company.
                    Although she is trying to step out of her comfort by opening up more, thus the creation of the website. In order for her to express herself,
                    she looks towards poetry and photography. Since she never really grew up in a proper home, she was never obligated to follow a certain religion. 
                    This has however helped her, by allowing her to search for her own answer or rather something that she feels comfortable with believing.

                    When she fell pregnant with Zariyah, her family saw this as an act of treachery.

                    She moved from country to country until she finally settled in south africa. Her mother never married and never had any other children.
