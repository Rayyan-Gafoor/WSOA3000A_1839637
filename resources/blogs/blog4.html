                    Zariyah.
                <br>
                Born 29 October 1996, in Afaganistan. Raised in multiple countries, by her single mother.
                She made a life for her South Africa. Although she travels a lot.
                As a child of war, Zariyah has become obssesed with idea of war and history.
                Thus resulting in her occupation has a historian and war photographer.

                    As a result from moving a lot during her childhood, she never really made any friends.
                    This led to a life of introversy. Even as an adult she struggles to socialise and would rather prefer her own company.
                    Although she is trying to step out of her comfort by opening up more, thus the creation of the website.
