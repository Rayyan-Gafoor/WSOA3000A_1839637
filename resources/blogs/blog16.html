                    <h2>Dealing With Covid-19 As A Student</h2>
                    <p>
                    I know, I know... It's a big shock to see me writting about this. But news flash yes I am an historian, yes I am a war journalist and yes I'm a student.
                    Anyway, we are not here to talk about me. We are here to talk about the WorldWide pandemic, COVID-19, and how it has effected the educational systems.
                    South Africa is just one of the countries facing this struggle. Honestly, when I first heard about this virus, i had no idea it would turn out the way it has.
                     This is not a fiction, we are living through history. As a result many countires have gone into a lockdown. The whole world has been ravaged by the fear of the virus.
                     If someone had came to us and told us that this would happen, what would we have done/said. For most of us our lives have completely converted to the virtual.
                     Social media has never been more important to human, than now (or at least that what I hope, remember people mental health is important).
                     But what does all of this mean for the students. How can we adapt and make the best of our situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h2>The Technologies</h2>
                        We need online learning more than ever now. Something that has lasted for years, has officially become one of the most important aspects of our lives.
                        But there are issues that come along with it.
                        Every student is different, and this is what educators need to realise (remember the medium is the message).
                        Some students can only efficiently learn under certain circumstances. Some prefer textsbooks, which can be further divided into soft and hard copies. 
                        I myself prefer to watch videos and read hardcopies rather than the alternative. Each learner would learn better according to the medium that best suits them and there needs.
                        Therefore it is important to look at Technologies that these students can use effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Types of learners and The Necessary Technologies</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The Doodler (Visual/ Spatial):<br>
                                These type of students prefer visual representation of the work. drawing diagrams makes it easier for them to uderstand different concepts and allows them to link topics easily.
                                Representing the work visually/ spatially allows them to focus and utitlise their visual memory. Making use of power points and diagrams in lecture slides if best suited for these students.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Listners..( And I am not talking about someone that can communicate with the Night Mother...):<br>
                                These type of students prefer to listen rather then do the actually reading. I honestly envey them, the ability to undertsand something without visually seeing it, is something I struggle with a lot.
                                Making use of podcast and recording can best aid these students. Also making use of regular meeting with the student to discuss ideas and topics can also greatly improve their performance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Hands-On type (Physical/ Kinesthetic)
                                We all now some people learn better through doing, making mistakes and correcting them.
                                <blockquote>
                                    "I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I undertsand"- Confucius
                                </blockquote>
                                By performing the necessary activities students can obtain the skills required as well as the undertsanding behind it.
                                Therefore making use of tutorials that the student can engage with would aid them in this area. Streaming live tutorials, which will allow the student to not only follow but also engage with the educator.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Social Freak (Interpersonal):<br>
                                These are learners that prefer socializing and communicating. Be it Video calls or simply texting, they are good at communicating their problems and undertsand feedback.
                                Therefore it is imperative to talk/communicate with these students in order to help. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The One Man Army:<br>
                                Honestly these students prefer not asking for assisstance, even when they need it the most.
                                Just making sure that the necessary material is there of them to use. Although I suggest having small compulsory meetings in place to keep track of the students performance,
                                as they do tend to fall behind at times.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        The technologies needed are things we normally would interact with at some point in our lives as students. These include:
                        <li>Zoom, Microsoft teams and Skype<br>
                            These are great for meetings, team planing and organising.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Educational intergrated websites:<br>
                            Most institutes already provide these. With the main purpose of posting learning material and communication between students and educators.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            PowerPoint- note and videos:<br>
                            Providing lecture notes and videos is key. 
                        </li>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>Accessibilty issues</h3>
                        Sure most of use might have these technologies at our disposal, but what about using them.
                        We live in South Africa people!!! We all know how expensive data can be, I should know, for the past three months I have spent at least R350 a week on data.
                        And yes a part of me is ashamed, I admit it, I can not live without the internet.
                        <iframe src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/telecommunications/313106/competition-commission-says-data-is-too-expensive-in-south-africa-heres-what-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=Data%20too%20expensive,other%20BRICS%20and%20SADC%20countries." width="900" height="500"  scrolling="auto" frameborder=0></iframe>
                        The "Digital Divide" has never been more prominant in our society than it is now. Access to the internet is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity that many are denied. The digital divide has proved to be a social injustice.

                       </p>
                       In the end, their is only one question that remains:<br>
                       Who exactly is responsible for the educational lives of students,
                       who should see to it that students can successfully continue on their current path, and complete the year?
                    </p>
