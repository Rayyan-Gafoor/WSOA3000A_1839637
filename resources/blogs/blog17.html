                        <h1>The Multi-Defined Interactvity</h1>
                        <p>
                            Over the years technology has prevailed and continued to evolved. This resulted in new forms of communication,
                            new forms of managing information, but more importantly new ways of sharing that information. New forms of media was born, andwith this birth 
                            came the rise of a new definition for the word "Interactvity". Although this definition has been proven to be very vague, leaving people with completely different understandings.
                            Honestly, why is this the case?
                            Langauge is meant to simplify the incomprehensible. Now we have a bunch of people ranging from authors to game designers attempting to rewrite the definition, and 
                            coming up with their own idea of what Interactvity means to them. They do this by breaking the previous persons definition down. You guys are making writting this blog quite difficult.
    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lets take a look at the different definitions:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Aaron Smuts' take on Interactvity:<br>
                                    Aaron begins his investigation by looking at what he calls "The Five Theories of Interactvity".
                                    He discusses and breaksdown these theories in order to develop a definition of his own (a bit ironic if you ask me).
                                    The five theories are:
                                    <uL>
                                        <li>Control Theory- Terrence Rafferty</li>
                                        <li>Making Use Theory- Marie-Laure Ryan</li>
                                        <li>Input/Output Theory- David Saltz</li>
                                        <li>Modifiable Structure Theory- Dominic Mclver Lopes's</li>
                                        <li>Procedural/Participatory Theory- Janet Murray</li>
                                    </uL>
                                    <br>
                                    By looking at these theories he begins to develop a theory of his own. He the states that something can only be Interactive if and only if:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            It is responsive
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            It does not completely control
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            It is not controlled
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            It does not respond in a random fashion( or at least not in the end).
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Well Honestly I belive this is vague, and that he has not successfully develop a working definition, but rather a partial one.
                                    I agree that yes, something should be responsive if it is to be interactive. Although, I do not believe
                                    it has to be predictable to be interactive. Take video games for example:<br>
                                    The games that are unpredictable are games that are fun, it what makes the game different from the others, but it is still interactive. 
                                    Don't get me wrong, once we finish the game, it does become predictable, but that does not necessarily mean it has ceases to be interactive.
                                    (Side note: Do you think our imaginations are interactive? I mean for some of us imagination can be dangerously unpredictable).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Lev Manovich Vs The Interactive:<br>
                                    Lev claims that calling any form of computer media interactive is meaningless, and that in doing so is committing a form or redundancy.
                                    he believes it is stating the most basic fact about computers. He goes further and says that the idea of "Interactvity" is nothing but an "illusion", and that the user is only invested in the illusion because it gives of a sense of control.
                                    The illusion is there because everthing the user does, or rather will do, has already been determined/preconcieved by the developers/designers.
                                    <p>
                                        This immediately makes me wonder aboutv life, just think about it... especially in terms of "religion" and "destiny".
                                        If everything is already set in stone, our choices, the parts we walk... Are we truly interacting  with life, are we truly living.
                                        Or is this just another aspect of Interactvity that will never be answered.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Espen Aarseth and Gonzalo Frasca:<br>
                                    Espen attempt to refrain from using the word "interactive". Instead he prefer to use the term "Ergodic".
                                    What is Ergodic Literature? Well my fellow confused peeps, he defines it as "texts that require nontrivial effort allowing the reader/user to traverse through it".
                                    I know right... What the heck does he mean by "nontrivial", well stay tuned and lets find out.
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        Gonzalo, a game designer who's game studies revolved around the work of Espen, expands on the definition above.
                                        He prefers using the phrase "active participation", basically clicking and typing, rather than the actions we would take when reading an actual book (turning pages).
                                        Honestly I have no idea how to futher break ths down. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Honestly I thought that when I reach the end of my reseach into this topic I will have my own definition.
                            Ha... I was wrong. The fact the word is used in a variety of topics and that holds a different definition in almost each one, makes defining it difficult.
                            In fact to add on to this, there exists a number complications in the definitions that already exist. Well I feel like we all need to look further into this.
                            My head is on fire. I hope this does not keep me awake for the week.
