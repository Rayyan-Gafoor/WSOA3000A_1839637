                        <h1>The Importance of Philosophy</h1>
                        <p>
                             What is Philosophy?<br>
                             Well according Oxford Dictionary, philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline.
                             Origin:
                            Middle English from Old French philosophie, via Latin from Greek philosophia ‘love of wisdom’.
                            Basically if you don't pursue wisdom, do you truly have a love for it? Can you call yourself a "Philosopher".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently I stumbled upon an odd animated series:"The Midnight Gospel". 
                            The story basically revolves around the protagonist, Clancy (played by Duncan Trussell), who is a "space-castor". Making use of podcast recorded from "Duncan Trussell Family Hour",
                            the show is then used to bring these interviews into perspective. To do this we see Clancy using what is called a universe simulator. At first I had no idea what the hell was going on, everything seemed to be happening all at once.
                            I was so distracted by the captivating, and mind-bending visuals, I completely overlooked the mind-expanding topics being discussed. And so I watched it a second time, but this time closing my eyes and just listening. And then it happened,
                            my mind was completely opened, it was like discovering a new perspective on life, discovering new philosophies. I immediately thought about why I could not see this the first time.
                            If you think about it, It is kind of like life. We have all these things distracting us from the truth, from what is truly important. But is there a way of focusing on both? This show attempts at proving that this is almost immposible, but I am sure there is a way,
                            to pursue both happines in life and its truth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The topics that are discussed seems all like on introspective look on life and death. Clancy, went on these bizarre adventures, pursuing the meaning behind these things, and in doing so he deliberately ignored the realities of life and death itself.
                            Is this what it means to be a philosopher, to pursue wisdom with the hope of never facing its truth? At some point in the show, we become aware that he lost his parents, immediately this triggers red flags, could this be the reason he tries to escape to these different universes.
                            Is this his way of running away?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h2>Exploring The idea of Multiple universes</h2>
                            As I said before, Clancy uses a virtual simulator that takes him trough a series of planets, space and even different universes.
                            Although each one he visits seems to be on the brink of death, some of them already non-existant, even before visiting them.
                            I have recently discovered my love for space and the universe, and only the dream of exploring it. When I watched this show, I realised that we will never see everything the multi-verse has to offer yet alone this universe.
                            But we should at least make due what we have now, pursue what we can now. Explore, live and find meaning to what matters to you. For Clancy, this is already somewhat possible.
                            For every universe he visits, there is a complex question that they "attempt" to answer, if you think about it perhaps the question in ours is to the meaning of life.
                            Anyway, immediately you get the sense that everyone has there on perspective on every different question. Now just take a second to imagine... In every single sentient being (at least of fifth order that is) there exists an answer.
                            An infinite amount answers to but only one question. Imagine how many answers lie out there in our universe, in our multi-verse.

                            <h1>Two Significant Moments</h1>
                            In the final episode of the first season, we are intoduced to Clancy's mother, or should I rather say Duncan's mother. By far the most interesting yet a very sad ending to a series I have ever experienced.
                            Perhaps this could be due to the relationship I shared with my own mother. You see the episode looks at an interview Duncan had with his mother before she passed away. The entire episode from visual context to everything being discussed,
                            the series takes on a combination of an emotional and thought-provoking form. Duncan (No longer Clancy) and his mother discusses intense topics we as humans tend to avoid:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Death</li>
                                <li>Presence</li>
                                <li>Spirituality</li>
                            </ul>
                            His mother attempts to give Duncan advice on how to feel present, how to become aware, how to draw attention from the mind. She tells him to focus his attention to his hand, to focus on the experience of sensation from within.
                            Once he achieves this she encrouges him to go even further, to experience this sensation through out his body. At the end of the journey, they gradually move towards the intense subjects. discussing her terminal illness, cancer, and her death.
                            According to the show, the cycle of life and death is a continuous one. One that is inevitable, one that we can never escape. And thus his mother's last lesson for him, "how to get over the loss of a loved one" ( Honestly, finding out that this was all recorded three weeks before she passed, makes the topic even more intense for viewers).
                            She teachers him how to cope with grief, that it is okay to cry and to turn towards the source of his pain, rather then runnning away and fighting against it. Clancy has choosen to run away almost his entire life,
                            trying to escape from the truth, from his truth. In his entire search for knowledge and attempts of escape, he had not realised that it was all leading him to the thing he dreaded most, "dealing with reality".
                            This is all evident throughout the show, as Clancy/Duncan, avoids a lot of his problems, and refuses to confront them.
                            In the end, he is faced with an enlightened state, and a new perspective on life and death. I guess the journey to enlightenment has always been part of facing the truth, rather then escaping by trying to find it in knowledge that could or could not benefit us.
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, I was left with what I consider, to essential forms of knowledge to have in life:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    How to be present
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    How to cope with grief
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
