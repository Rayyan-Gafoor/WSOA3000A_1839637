                    Zariyah.
                <br>
                Born 29 October 1996, in Afaganistan. Raised in multiple countries, by her single mother.<br>
                She made a life for her South Africa. Although she travels a lot.<br>
                As a child of war, Zariyah has become obssesed with idea of war and history.<br>
                Thus resulting in her occupation has a historian and war photographer.<br>
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result from moving a lot during her childhood, she never really made any friends.<br>
                    This led to a life of introversy. Even as an adult she struggles to socialise and would rather prefer her own company.<br>
                    Although she is trying to step out of her comfort by opening up more, thus the creation of the website.<br>
